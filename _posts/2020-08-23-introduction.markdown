Most of the articles I read, podcasts I listen to, or videos I watch about DevOps are coming from the context of working on teams, whether large or small. While many of the latest technologies (Kubernetes, Docker, Git, etc...) are designed for team collaboration, these are still relevant for those who aren't part of teams.

Whether you're the sole IT person in your organization, owner of your own company, freelance on the side, or are just working on your own personal projects, **Lonely DevOps** is for you!

I'll be posting things I learn and quick tips on how to understand DevOps concepts - hopefully they're helpful to you as well. Having worked on very small teams and with non-profit organizations who have little to no IT budget, I'll also try to avoid services which you have to pay for. While they reduce the amount of overhead you have to manage, it's usually harder for small organizations to get on board with those solutions.
